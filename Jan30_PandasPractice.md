# 🏆 Week 5 Practice: Putting it all Together

Today is a review and practice day. You will apply everything you've learned this week about Pandas:
1. Creating Series & DataFrames
2. Reading External Data
3. Inspecting Data
4. Filtering & Sorting

## Challenge Overview:
You will work with a small "Sales Dataset" to answer business questions.

## Today's Tasks:
* Open `Jan30_PandasPractice.ipynb`.
* Follow the instructions to load, inspect, and filter the sales data.
* Try to find the most expensive products and the total row count after filtering.

Good luck! Pandas is the heart of data analysis in Python—getting comfortable now will make future weeks much easier.
