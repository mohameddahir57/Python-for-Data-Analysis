#  Feb 09: Week 7 Final Practice Challenge

Congratulations on reaching the final day of Week 7! This practice session combines everything you've learned about data visualization.

## The Challenge: E-Commerce Analytics Dashboard

You've been hired as a data analyst for an online retail company. Your task is to create a comprehensive visualization report analyzing their sales data.

## Dataset Overview
The dataset contains:
- **Order Date**: When the order was placed
- **Category**: Product category (Electronics, Clothing, Home, Books, Sports)
- **Region**: Sales region (North, South, East, West)
- **Sales Amount**: Revenue from the sale
- **Quantity**: Number of items sold
- **Customer Age**: Age of the customer
- **Customer Type**: New or Returning customer

## Your Tasks

### 1. Time Series Analysis
Create visualizations to answer:
- What is the overall sales trend over time?
- Are there any seasonal patterns?
- Which months perform best?

**Recommended**: Line chart with proper formatting

### 2. Category Performance
Analyze and visualize:
- Which product categories generate the most revenue?
- How do categories compare in terms of average order value?

**Recommended**: Bar chart (sorted) or horizontal bar chart

### 3. Regional Analysis
Explore:
- How do sales vary across regions?
- Which regions have the highest and lowest performance?
- Are there regional preferences for certain categories?

**Recommended**: Bar chart, grouped bar chart, or stacked bar chart

### 4. Customer Demographics
Investigate:
- What is the age distribution of customers?
- Do different age groups prefer different product categories?
- How does spending vary by age?

**Recommended**: Histogram, box plot, or violin plot

### 5. Customer Behavior
Analyze:
- What's the split between new and returning customers?
- Do returning customers spend more than new customers?

**Recommended**: Pie chart, bar chart with comparison

### 6. Relationships
Discover:
- Is there a relationship between quantity and sales amount?
- Does customer age correlate with spending?

**Recommended**: Scatter plot with regression line

### 7. Comprehensive Dashboard
Create a final dashboard that combines:
- 4-6 key visualizations
- Clear titles and labels
- Professional color scheme
- Logical layout

## Evaluation Criteria

Your visualizations will be evaluated on:

### ✅ Correctness (30%)
- Did you choose the right chart type for each question?
- Are the visualizations accurate?

### ✅ Clarity (30%)
- Are titles, labels, and legends clear?
- Can insights be understood in 5 seconds?
- Is the message obvious?

### ✅ Aesthetics (20%)
- Professional color schemes
- Proper spacing and layout
- Consistent styling

### ✅ Insights (20%)
- Did you extract meaningful insights?
- Are patterns and trends highlighted?
- Do you provide context?

## Tips for Success

### 📊 Chart Selection
- **Trends over time** → Line chart
- **Category comparison** → Bar chart (sorted)
- **Distribution** → Histogram or box plot
- **Composition** → Pie or stacked bar
- **Relationships** → Scatter plot

###  Styling
- Use consistent color palette
- Add grid for easier reading
- Format axes (currency, percentages)
- Use appropriate figure sizes

###  Labeling
- Clear, descriptive titles
- Axis labels with units
- Legends when needed
- Value labels on bars when helpful

###  Best Practices
- Sort bar charts by value
- Start y-axis at zero (usually)
- Highlight key insights with color
- Remove unnecessary elements
- Test readability

## Bonus Challenges

If you finish early, try these advanced tasks:

###  Advanced Analysis
1. Create a heatmap showing sales by region and category
2. Build a pair plot exploring multiple variable relationships
3. Add trend lines and annotations to highlight key events
4. Create animated visualizations showing trends over time
5. Design an interactive dashboard concept

###  Statistical Insights
1. Calculate and visualize correlation coefficients
2. Add confidence intervals to bar charts
3. Show percentile ranges in distributions
4. Identify and highlight outliers
5. Perform and visualize hypothesis tests

## Deliverables

Create the following in your Jupyter notebook:

1. **Data Exploration** (5 minutes)
   - Load and inspect the data
   - Check for missing values
   - Basic statistics

2. **Individual Visualizations** (30 minutes)
   - One chart for each of the 6 tasks above
   - Well-formatted and labeled

3. **Comprehensive Dashboard** (15 minutes)
   - 4-6 key visualizations in one figure
   - Professional layout
   - Clear story

4. **Insights Summary** (10 minutes)
   - Key findings from your analysis
   - Recommendations based on data
   - Next steps for the business

## Why This Matters
