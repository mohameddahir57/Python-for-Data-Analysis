# 📊 Jan 23 — Mathematical Operations

## 1. Element-wise Operations
NumPy allows you to perform operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, etc.) on arrays element-by-element without writing loops.
-   `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`

## 2. Broadcasting
Broadcasting allows NumPy to perform operations on arrays of different shapes (e.g., adding a scalar to a matrix).

## 3. Universal Functions (ufuncs)
NumPy provides optimized functions for mathematical operations.
-   `np.sqrt()`, `np.exp()`, `np.sin()`, `np.log()`

## 4. Aggregation
Functions to summarize data.
-   `np.sum()`, `np.mean()`, `np.min()`, `np.max()`
