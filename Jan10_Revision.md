## 🏗️ The Challenge: Simple Sales Calculator

Build a program that simulates a small grocery store checkout.

### Requirements:
1.  **Welcome**: Print a nice welcome message.
2.  **Input**: Ask for the customer's name.
3.  **Data**: Ask for the price of 3 different items (e.g., Apple, Banana, Bread).
4.  **Math**: 
    - Calculate the **Subtotal** (sum of 3 items).
    - Apply a **Discount** of 10% (Subtotal * 0.10).
    - Calculate the **Final Total** (Subtotal - Discount).
5.  **Output**: Use f-strings to print a receipt that shows the customer's name, the subtotal, the discount amount, and the final total.
